# WeatherApp
A very basic Weather App

To build and run this app, you'll need an API from openweathermap.org.

You can create one for yourself at http://api.openweathermap.org/ 

Although this isn't that stable an API and may crash sometimes, its free and is good enough to do our job.

If you want to use a different API, you can find one at http://www.programmableweb.com/

Infact any API for any app that you want to create can be found at this website. Feel free to browse through them.
