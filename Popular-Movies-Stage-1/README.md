# Popular-Movies-Stage-1
Android ND Stage 1 of the Popular Movies App

To build and run this app, you'll need an API key from themoviedb.org.   

First, sign up to themoviedb.org
https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup

Then select API from the menu on the left hand side and follow to create your own API key.   


Next up in our code files, add your API key to the code by adding the following to your ~/.MovieFragment.java file:
  
private static final String THE_MOVIE_DB_API_KEY = "MyMovieDbAPIKey";

Just replace MyMovieDbAPIKey by YOUR-OWNAPI-KEY and you would be good to go.
